## SQL Queries Explained

The SQL queries in this project perform various analyses on the COVID-19 data from the `PortfolioProject` database. Here is a brief explanation of what each set of queries does:

### General Data Queries
These queries retrieve and organize data from the `CovidDeaths` table, ordering the results by specified columns for easier analysis.

### Country-Specific Analysis
These queries focus on specific countries, such as India, to calculate metrics like the death percentage from total cases and total deaths. They filter data to show results only for the specified country.

### Population and Infection Rates
These queries calculate the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in different countries. They identify countries with the highest infection rates by comparing total cases to population size.

### Global and Continental Analysis
These queries provide insights at the global and continental levels. They identify countries and continents with the highest total deaths and calculate global death percentages over time and overall.

### Vaccination Data Analysis
These queries join the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables to analyze vaccination rates alongside infection and death data. They calculate total vaccinations over time and compare them to the population size.

### Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into more manageable parts. These queries calculate the total vaccinations over time and the percentage of the population vaccinated using a CTE.

### Temporary Tables
These queries create and populate temporary tables to store intermediate results. They calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated and allow for further analysis on this temporary data.

### Creating Views
Views are created to store results of complex queries for easy access and visualization. These queries create a view that holds the percentage of the population vaccinated, which can be used for later visualizations and analysis.

Each query set helps in understanding different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress across different regions and time periods.
